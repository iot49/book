    "All your files on the Raspberry PI are stored on the SD Card. These cards sometimes fail, or you may inadvertently delete a file. It's important to keep backups.\n",

    "*ide49* makes this easy. It comes with [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/), a versatile backup solution. Access it at https://iot49.local/duplicati or from the dashboard at https://iot49.local.\n",

    "Click `+ Add backup` and configure a new backup. Choose Encryption and a Passphrase if you like (I do not bother as I don't keep personal information on the Raspberry PI).\n",

    "Duplicati offers many backup destinations. Under `Storage Type` you find all the popular online services (Dropbox, Google Cloud, etc). \n",

    "Alternatively you can backup to local storage. Insert a USB thumb drive into the Raspberry PI. It will show up under `Folder path` in the `mnt` folder. \n",
