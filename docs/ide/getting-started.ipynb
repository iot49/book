    "*ide49* offers a range of features including a code editor, compilers (e.g. to compile MicroPython), an MQTT broker, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "All interaction with microcontrollers takes place in the [*Jupyter Lab*](https://jupyter.org/) service. *Jupyter* is a popular interactive Python programming environment. You can find many online tutorials and videos. Below we quickly go over the main features with special focus on the customizations for programming microcontrollers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access *Jupyter Lab* in *ide49*, go to https://iot49.local/jupyter (change the name if you modified the DNS name of the Raspberry PI) or from the *Jupyter* link of *ide49* dashboard at https://iot49.local.\n",

    "For illustration, the key features are highlighted. The main features include a *Python 3 Kernel* for executing code on the Raspberry PI, a *Terminal* for running shell commands, and, the **IoT Kernel** for programming microcontrollers. Click on that button to get a new window:\n",

    "Like all *Jupyter* kernels, you type code into *cells*, and click `shift-return` (return while holding down the shift key) to execute it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",

    "<img src=\"figures/no_device_connected.png\" alt=\"No device\" width=\"250\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The error is not surprising, since, well, we have not yet connected a microcontroller to the Raspberry PI. Head over to the *IOT* section if you are anxious.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even if you are familiar with *Jupyter*, you may want to first check out the special features of the *IoT Kernel*. Like other *Jupyter* kernels, it implements several *magics*, lines that start with a percent sign `%` in the first column. To get a list of magics available in the *IoT Kernel*, execte the magic `%lsmagic%`: type it into an empty cell and hit `shift-return`:"
