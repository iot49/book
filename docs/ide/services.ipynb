    "You get a simple menu with several option including *Jupyter*, *Editor*, *Backup*, etc. The first time you click a link you will be asked to login. The default is login and password are both *iot49*. Instructions for how to change it are [here](security.ipynb).\n",

    "* [Jupyter](services/jupyter.ipynb) is a [code execution environment](https://jupyter.org/) that is quite popular among datascientists and is also a great option for interacting with and programming microcontrollers.\n",
    "* [Editor](services/editor.ipynb) is an Internet enabled version of [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a powerful coding envornment.\n",
    "* [Backup](services/backup.ipynb) is a versatile applications for backing up the data on your Raspberry PI to the cloud or local storage. It is based on [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/).\n",
    "* The [Webbrowser] is implemented with [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/). It operates as a reverse proxy responsible for encryption and password protection and serves *ide49* the landing page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other options are more specialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Plots](services/plotserver.ipynb) is a plotting environment that is convenient to display sensor data in a browser window. Microcontrollers can send this data directly to the *plot* application.\n",
    "* [Balena CLI](services/balena-cli.ipynb) is the tool used to create and modify applications such as *ide49*. It lets you change *ide49* right from *ide49* itself!\n",

    "Additional services provided by *ide49* include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [MQTT broker](services/mosquitto.ipynb).\n",
    "* [Samba/CIFS file server](services/samba.ipynb) that exports user data stored on the Raspberry PI. It is disabled by default.\n",
    "* [ARM cross compiler](services/gcc.ipynb) used to compile MicroPython and other microcontroller applications written in C/C++."
