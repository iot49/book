    "[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) is a port of [Python](https://www.python.org/) to [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller).\n",

    "A wide variety of devices are supported by MicroPython that cover a wide range of computer power, peripherals, wireless connectivity, power dissipation. In this overview we use an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32). With built-in support for [WiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) and [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) it is well suited for IoT projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like all computer chips, the ESP32 requires a few additional components - memory, a USB interface, power supply - to operate. Fortunately breakout boards are available that not only contain these circuits but also a mechanically and electrically conventient interface for connecting with IoT projects.\n",

    "Boards are available from several vendors including the manufacturer. Below we use the [TinyPICO](https://www.tinypico.com/), but boards from other vendors will work with minor modifications to the code."
